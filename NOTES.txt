Panel-Region-Tile system:
	Panel becomes just a Region, there is no need to separate the two.
	Rename the class Panel to Region.

Tile entity system.
	Tiles can have unique features located on them, such as trees or valuable resources.
	Tiles should have a separate entity property - either a vector of entities, or a singular entity - that would be drawn to the screen, when the tile itself is drawn.
	Entity class should be easy to use, and understand.

	Entity:
		?parent*        --- pointer to the tile owning that entity.
		texture        --- texture of the entity.
		texture_size   --- size of the entity's texture.
		texture_origin --- offset from the top left of the texture to the point which will be considered texture's origin.
