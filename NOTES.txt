	Region is both a representation of a worldmap "panel" and of a region with tiles.
	Tiles are smallest units of distance. As a group they represent a region.

Tile entity system.
	Tiles can have unique features, such as trees or valuable resources.
	Thus tiles should have a separate entity property - either a vector of entities, or a singular entity - that would be drawn to the screen, when the tile itself is drawn.
	Entity class should be easy to use, and understand.
