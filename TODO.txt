LEGEND:
    [?] - Consider.
    [!] - Important.
    [.] - Can wait.

[!] Make sure that virtual functions from different classes have matching return type.
[?] Create a separate class for a scene UI so that the cluttered and messy code is separated from the game logic itself, and provide public methods update() and render() to include in the level loop.
[!] When selecting a tile by searching for it in the vector, try checking only adjacent tiles, because this will be faster and it's not possible to move more than one tile at a time.
[!] For information about the region's biome use and create functions in worldGenerator class. For other purposes (such as information about a river, or a forest) use the bit representation system.
[!] Think of a way to generate rivers in other directions than horizontal and vertical (Look into circle related math?).
