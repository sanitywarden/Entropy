Entropy is a isometric strategy game written in C++ and Lua.\
It uses SFML as the framework for graphics and audio, Lua for scripting and LuaBridge for binding C++ code to Lua and vice versa.

## Plans

Keep in mind that Entropy is a passion project, so the speed of work varies.\
Long term goals include:
- Create a game loop with fun things to do.
- Create AI opponents.
- Polish existing content.
- Make the game easily modifiable.
