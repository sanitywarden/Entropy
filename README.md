# Entropy
## Overwiew
Entropy is a procedural world generator written in C++.\
It uses SFML as the framework for utilities such as graphics, audio etc.

## Plans
I plan on making Entropy a simulation of some sort.\
In the future I would like to make Entropy a small strategy game where a player controls a tribe and expands it.\
Current plans (unordered):
- Implement simple AI
- Implement population
- Draw basic building textures

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- G++ (11.2.0)
- SFML (2.5.1)

### Compiling
The version of my g++ compiler is 11.2.0 for Windows.\
If you find any problems while compiling I will not help, so you are on your own.\
For compiling I use the command located inside `~/app.bat` file.
