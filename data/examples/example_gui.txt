A GUI is described by 2 Lua files:

First file is a .luagui file and it describes how a GUI looks.
It's structure is:

UI = {
    id        - unique string
    closeable - if the GUI should have a visible "close" button 
    movable   - if the GUI can be dragged and moved
    resizable - if the GUI can be manually resized

    components = {} - list of components. See COMPONENTS below.
}

Second file is a .luafun file and it describes the behavior of components.
It's structure is:

functionality = {
    id - unique string

    components = {} - list of components. See COMPONENTS below.
}

Each component has unique properties which describe how it looks and how it behaves.
COMPONENTS:
Widget
Button
Label
Image
ImageList
